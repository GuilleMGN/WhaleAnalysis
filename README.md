# WhaleAnalysis

Harold's company has been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best.

We can apply these quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, so we can help him determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

A tool was created (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others.
